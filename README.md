This repository,  `myGENIE`, is for saving work/documentation/scripts relevant to GENIE simulations.

The file `notes.txt` contains useful annotations from meeting w/ Afroditi Papadopoulou and Josh Barrow on initial setup of GENIE on the fermilab gpvm machines as well as basic steps to do GENIE simulations.  

The directory `cyero_examples` contains the output of the 1st example I tried following Afro's instructions on `notes.txt`

The directory `simulation` contains scripts to generate simulation files using the GENIE event generator (these scripts should only be run on FermiLab genie gpvm machines)
