Caleb will copy all relevant script to here:
/scratch/cfogler/e4nu/Simulation/

convert *.gst.root to lund format in ifarm


1) source environment.csh

2) Use LUND_fromGenie_C.C to convert .gst to .dat (lund file format)
 there will be many lund files generated and written to output

3) cd submit/6gev, and run: submit_recon_6gev_D.sh (for example, for deuteron)
this shell  script converts calls multiple commands, whihc ultimately converts to .hipo file
sbatch submit_recon_6gev_D.sh,  to submit job (maybe slurm?)

to check run status of job submission: squeue -u cyero
